This page shows exactly what I ate for 1 week, from December 12, 2020, to December 19, 2020. It includes the good and the bad foods. A lot of the pictures are bad because I ate from bowls where many ingredients were hidden below other ingredients; I'm going to capture my eating for another week and I'll use plates instead so that all foods are captured on photos.
