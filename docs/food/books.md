In this section, I talk about the books and websites that helped me learn about digestive issues and how to fix them.

I got most of these books from my local libraries, so I did not need to pay for anything.

* [Nourishing Traditions](https://www.amazon.com/Nourishing-Traditions-Challenges-Politically-Dictocrats/dp/0967089735/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3XPSWVH1UI8E&dchild=1&keywords=nourishing+traditions&qid=1587049164&sprefix=nourishing+traditions%2Caps%2C219&sr=8-1) by Sally Fallon
	* has other books in the "Nourishing" Series. I read [Nourishing Broth](https://www.amazon.com/Nourishing-Broth-Old-Fashioned-Remedy-Modern-ebook/dp/B00HQ2N2KA/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=nourishing+broths&qid=1587049490&sr=8-1) as well, which has more detailed info about broth and broth recipes.

* [Digestive Health with Real Food](https://www.amazon.com/Digestive-Health-REAL-Updated-Expanded/dp/0988717271/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=digestive+health+with+real+food&qid=1587049186&sr=8-1) by Agla√©e Jacob

	* They're [blog](https://www.nourishingdays.com/) has some of the recipes from this book.

* There are so many books that focus on fermentation recipes. I have read a few, and anybody's local libraries should have good selections. The call number is 664.024.
