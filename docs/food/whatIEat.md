*I'm not 100% strict on my diet. I probably adhere 80% to my diet principles. Sometimes, I still consciously eat foods that I think are unhealthy.*

# My Diet Logic

I've believed this logic since I was in high school, but only implemented it all into my diet when I was 22, after having severe digestive issues, explained in my post about [digestive issues](/food/digestiveIssues). This is the only diet I tried that completely eliminated all of my digestive issues.

I believe that cultures evolved their diets to make foods more digestible and more nutritious. This view follows the [Weston A. Price Foundation](https://www.westonaprice.org/)'s stance on diet. [**Here is a video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-WKkCIpNxQ) by Sarah Pope from the Weston A. Price Foundation that explains traditional eating much better than I could.

Here's my logic on diet.
* Traditional diets that our human ancestors followed have elements that made people healthy.
* Many modern diets that people follow today have elements that make people sick.
* We can be healthier if we follow traditional diets more and modern diets less.

So I try to eat more foods that are prepared the same ways that our ancestors prepared them. That is why my diet is so weird and inconvenient compared to the standard American diet.

# Food Quality

I try to buy high quality foods. I go for organic vegetables, pasture raised animal products, raw dairy, etc.

These foods are usually more expensive than other options. However, I don't mind spending money on high quality foods because food is what keeps me healthy and keeps me away from potentially needing to buy expensive medicine. Even though I buy expensive food, I save a lot of money by preparing almost all of my food.

# Examples of What I Eat

In this section, I show some details about foods from different food categories, including how they should be prepared for good digestion. The info and opinions mostly line up with the Weston A. Price Foundation's dietary guidelines.

My diet is inclusive; I eat foods from every food group. I don't avoid any foods. I just limit my intake of foods that are not prepared properly, because they could cause digestive issues.

The most dangerous foods for digestive issues, from my experience, are grains, beans, nuts, and seeds. If these are not prepared properly, they can be difficult to digest.

## Animal Products (excluding dairy)

I try to buy products from animals raised on a pasture without use of antibiotics or hormones.

Having said that, I actually don't eat much meat. When I do eat animal products, excluding dairy, I usually eat eggs, organ meats, and bone broth. These are usually much cheaper than muscle meat.


| Food | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Muscle meat | Tough meat should be slow-cooked to make it soft. |
| Eggs | These should not be eaten raw. Eggs do not get digested well if they are raw. A book titled *Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human* by Richard Wrangham sites multiple studies showing that eating raw eggs yields more undigested protein in people's poop than cooked eggs. |
| Organ meat | Liver and heart are the easiest for me to find, and they are delicious. Some organs are traditionally eaten raw, but this is dangerous unless the meat is known to be handled properly and harvested from a healthy animal. |
| Bone broth | Bone broth is traditionally eaten by many cultures and helps with digestion. Most bone broth bought in stores is not real bone broth, because it contains such little gelatin. The broth should gelatinize in the fridge. Health food stores have frozen bone broth in the freezer section. Chicken broth is known as Jewish Penicillin because it helps when one is sick. |
| Bone marrow | Bone marrow is tasty but it is extremely rich in fat, which makes it hard for me to eat a lot of. |

## Dairy

I consume dairy after it is fermented. I buy cheese and butter made from pasteurized milk from grass-fed cows. I eat tons of butter.

I think non-fermented raw whole milk is healthy to drink, but I do not like plain milk, so I don't drink it.

| Food | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Butter | Costco sells Kerrygold butter, which is Irish butter that is mostly grass-fed. I use butter for cooking and add it to foods like oatmeal and bread. |
| Ghee | I make my own ghee from butter. I sometimes infuse it with herbs and garlic to make it more interesting. |
| Raw milk | This can be consumed plain or fermented. Whole milk is more nutritious than skim milk. |
| Pasteurized milk | This should not be consumed plain, because pasteurization kills microbes and destroys enzymes, making pasteurized milk harder to digest than raw milk. This product should only be consumed after being fermented. Yogurt, kefir, cheese, etc. are good. |
| Cheese | Aged cheeses like cheddar and parmasean are easier to digest than young cheeses like riccota because more of the lactose has been removed by the fermentation. Costco sells Kerrygold cheese from mostly grass-fed cows. |
| Milk Kefir | Storebought milk kefir is usually not true milk kefir because it is made with a few specific microbe strains, rather than being made with milk kefir grains. I make my own milk kefir from home. Storebought kefir is better than plain milk, but not as good as homemade. |

## Fruits and Vegetables (excluding grains, beans, seeds, and nuts)

I mostly eat vegetables that are prepared to be easy to digest. For some vegetables, this includes fermentation, which makes vegetables sour and delicious. For some, it just includes cooking. Raw vegetables can be hard to digest and should not be eaten in large quantities.

I basically avoid salads and any raw leafy greens. Yes, salads have a lot of nutrients, but these nutrients only help us if they can be digested, and ruffage is not easy for humans to digest.

| Food | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Sauerkraut | This is fermented cabbage made from cabbage and salt. It is a common European food and is very tasty. I let the cabbage ferment for about 2 months before starting to eat it. |
| Fermented vegetables | Many vegetables can be fermented in a saltwater brine. I like using radishes, turnips, beets, and some other veggies. These are good to eat after a couple weeks. |
| Cooked vegetables | Vegetables should be cooked appropriately to break down fibers and remove any bad toxins or antinutrients. For example, yucca root must be cooked thoroughly to remove cyanide and some leafy greens need to steamed to remove oxalates. |
| Vegetables with skin | I recommend peeling any vegetables that have rough skin. My grandma always peeled her potatoes; that's all the reason I need to peel potatoes.
| Fruits | It's also good to peel fruits before eating. Fruits should probably be eaten very ripe if they are raw, or they can be cooked. I don't personally crave fruits ever. I like cooking green plantains into tostones. |

## Grains, Beans, Seeds, and Nuts

Most foods in this category need to be soaked and or fermented to be healthy. One huge exception is white rice, which seems to be somewhat easy to digest without soaking.

I eat a lot of fermented oatmeal and sourdough bread. These are very cheap. The oatmeal is easy to make, but the sourdough bread is very time-consuming.

I rarely eat any of these foods if they are not prepared properly because they give me digestive issues.

| Food | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Beans | Traditionally, many beans were fermented for long periods of time -- a few days to potentially years -- before they were eaten. Soybeans should absolutely not be eaten without being fermented. |
| Nuts and seeds | These should be soaked and or fermented, possibly with skins removed. Storebought trail mixes can be very hard to digest. |
| Sourdough bread | Traditionally, all bread was leavened with yeast from sourdough starter. Baker's yeast was developed in the 1900s and is an industrial product; bread made from baker's yeast is not easy to digest. Also bread was traditionally made from whole grain flours rather than white flours. |
| Oatmeal | Oats should be fermented then cooked. Oats can be fermented using different starter cultures including sauerkraut juice, sourdough starter, yogurt, and milk kefir. |
| Corn | Corn should be nixtamalized by soaking in lime (not the fruit), and possibly fermenting. If a corn tortilla does not have trace amounts of lime as an ingredient, the corn is not nixtamalized and may be hard to digest. |

## Other Products including Condiments

The healthiest oils are fats from healthy pasture-raised animals. Saturated fat is healthy. The only oils that should be cooked with are oils high in saturated fats; animal fats, coconut oil, palm oil. Other oils were not traditionally cooked with and I personally get very oily skin and acne if I eat oils that are low in saturated fat.

I eat raw honey somewhat regularly. I craved and ate honey constantly when I was recovering from digestive issues, and it probably helped me gain weight when I needed to. I let myself eat as much honey as I want, but I just don't crave it much and can't eat much of it.

| Food | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Refined oils | These oils are made using chemicals, and were not made until the 1900s. This includes soybean oil, corn oil, and many other "healthy" vegetable oils. |
| Unrefined, pressed oils | These oils are traditionally extracted. They include some olive oils, coconut oils, palm oils, etc. |
| Raw honey | Honey should be raw. Raw honey is good for fermenting some veggies. |
| Maple syrup | This should be real maple syrup, not Aunt Jemima's or Mrs. Buttersworth's. |
| Herbs and spices | These are good of course, as long as they don't have artificial additives. |


# Foods that I almost never eat

There are some foods that I think are unhealthy enough that I just avoid.

| Food | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| Non-fermented wheat products | No cookies, cakes, non-sourdough bread, etc. I make my own sourdough bread products like pizza, baguettes, boules, etc.|
| Non-fermented beans and nuts | This includes any trail mix, "health" protein bars, common soy products, etc. |
| High fructose corn syrup | Obviously, this is not healthy or natural. Foods with a lot more fructose than glucose tend to ferment quickly in the gut, which can cause digestive issues. |
