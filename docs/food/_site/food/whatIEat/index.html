<p><em>I’m not 100% strict on my diet. I probably adhere 90% to my diet principles. Sometimes, I still consciously eat foods that I think are unhealthy.</em></p>

<h1 id="my-diet-logic">My Diet Logic</h1>

<p>I’ve believed this logic since I was 13 years old, but only implemented it all into my diet when I was 22, after having severe digestive issues, explained in my post about <a href="/food/digestiveIssues">digestive issues</a>. This is the only diet I tried that completely eliminated all of my digestive issues.</p>

<p>I believe that cultures evolved their diets to make foods more digestible and more nutritious. This view follows the <a href="https://www.westonaprice.org/">Weston A. Price Foundation</a>’s stance on diet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-WKkCIpNxQ"><strong>Here is a video</strong></a> by Sarah Pope from the Weston A. Price Foundation that explains traditional eating much better than I could.</p>

<p>Here’s my logic on diet.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traditional diets that our human ancestors followed have elements that made people healthy.</li>
  <li>Many modern diets that people follow today have elements that make people sick.</li>
  <li>We can be healthier if we follow traditional diets more and modern diets less.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I try to eat more foods that are prepared the same ways that our ancestors prepared them. That is why my diet is so weird and inconvenient compared to the standard American diet.</p>

<h1 id="food-quality">Food Quality</h1>

<p>I try to buy high quality foods. I go for organic vegetables, pasture raised animal products, raw dairy, etc.</p>

<p>These foods are usually more expensive than other options. However, I don’t mind spending money on high quality foods because food is what keeps me healthy and keeps me away from potentially needing to buy expensive medicine. I actually save a lot of money by preparing almost all of my food.</p>

<h1 id="examples-of-what-i-eat">Examples of What I Eat</h1>

<p>In this section, I show some details about foods from different food categories, including how they should be prepared for good digestion. The info and opinions mostly line up with the Weston A. Price Foundation’s dietary guidelines.</p>

<p>My diet is inclusive; I eat foods from every food group. I don’t avoid any foods. I just limit my intake of foods that are not prepared properly, because they could cause digestive issues.</p>

<p>The most dangerous foods for digestive issues, from my experience, are grains, beans, nuts, and seeds. If these are not prepared properly, they can be difficult to digest.</p>

<h2 id="animal-products-excluding-dairy">Animal Products (excluding dairy)</h2>

<p>I try to buy products from animals raised on a pasture without use of antibiotics or hormones.</p>

<p>Having said that, I actually don’t eat much meat. When I do eat animal products, excluding dairy, I usually eat eggs, organ meats, and bone broth. These are usually much cheaper than muscle meat.</p>

<h2 id="dairy">Dairy</h2>

<p>I consume dairy after it is fermented. I buy cheese and butter made from pasteurized milk from grass-fed cows. I eat tons of butter.</p>

<p>I think non-fermented raw whole milk is healthy to drink, but I do not like plain milk, so I don’t drink it.</p>

<h2 id="fruits-and-vegetables-excluding-grains-beans-seeds-and-nuts">Fruits and Vegetables (excluding grains, beans, seeds, and nuts)</h2>

<p>I mostly eat vegetables that are prepared to be easy to digest. For some vegetables, this includes fermentation, which makes vegetables sour and delicious. For some, it just includes cooking. Raw vegetables can be hard to digest and should not be eaten in large quantities.</p>

<p>I basically avoid salads and any raw leafy greens. Yes, salads have a lot of nutrients, but these nutrients only help us if they can be digested, and ruffage is not easy for humans to digest.</p>

<h2 id="grains-beans-seeds-and-nuts">Grains, Beans, Seeds, and Nuts</h2>

<p>Most foods in this category need to be soaked and or fermented to be healthy. One huge exception is white rice, which seems to be somewhat easy to digest without soaking.</p>

<p>I eat a lot of fermented oatmeal and sourdough bread. These are very cheap. The oatmeal is easy to make, but the sourdough bread is very time-consuming.</p>

<p>I rarely eat any of these foods if they are not prepared properly because they give me digestive issues.</p>
